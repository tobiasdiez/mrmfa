#' Calc steel scrap consumption
#' @description
#' Function to calculate steel scrap consumption based on World Steel
#' Association (see \link{readWorldSteelDigitised})
#' data and Bureau of International Recycling (BIR) (see
#' \link{readBIR}) data. Different subtypes allow to either use
#' assumptions to fill data gaps or not.
#'
#' With assumptions, basic backcasting by production data and forecasting
#' via BIR data is used. For no assumptions, only linear interpolation is used.
#' Data is manipulated so that when aggregating regions with missing data
#' in less relevant subunits, these missing data are set to 0 to avoid NAs in
#' the regional aggregation (as well as global aggregation).
#'
#' The countries were NA should be zeroed are defined in
#' scrap_consumption_countries_2_zero.csv .
#'
#' @param subtype Subtype of steel scrap consumption data to calculate.
#' Options: 'assumptions' or 'noAssumptions'. Must be set deliberately.
